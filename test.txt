tomorrow nearly six hundred million people will go to the polls in india to elect a new lower house of parliament
this has been described as the world's largest organized human activity
the elections could determine india's next prime minister who will have to lead a nation of almost one billion people and a multitude of religions castes classes and conflicts
indians say they regard their constitutional right to vote as both a privilege and responsibility
but because all of the country's major parties are embroiled in a massive corruption scandal many voters say they are fed up with politics
they're questioning whether the elections are an exercise in democracy or hypocrisy
from new delhi n. p. r.'s chitra ragavan reports
in the heart of new dehli on the banks of the yamuna river lies an oasis from the endless noise and relentless pace of india's capital city
it's the raj kat a memorial marking where mahatma ghandi was cremated
it's been almost fifty years since india achieved its independence from british rule thanks to the sacrifices of leaders such as ghandi and jawaharlal nehru india's first prime minister
they were determined to free their country not only from the shackles of imperialism but also castism and religious and political opportunism
there are many who say that on the eve of electing its eleventh lockshava the lower house of parliament india is adrift rudderless a nation without true leaders
nene balkevala is a senior advocate for the indian supreme court and a distinguished political commentator
we are running a third class democracy under a first class constitution
our constitution was conceived by very great men
i cannot recognize the same country which gave itself the constitution in the year nineteen fifty because the whole quality is so different
we told that we would have first class people in charge of the country
instead we've got absolutely third rate men
balkevala is but one of thousands who can be heard these days on the streets on their morning walks and talking in the parks and in their stores offices and homes wondering what's to become of their democracy
a massive corruption scandal has tainted political leaders from the ruling congress party to the main opposition party the nationalist vjp or party agenta party and it has thrown the elections into a tailspin and put many voters in a deeply pessimistic frame of mind about their political leaders and the future of their country and this pessimism has touched every class of people
for india's poor whose only postal address is the street on which they sleep they feel democracy has failed to provide the most basic necessities
one example is pondu a huge industrial area and home to one of the largest slums in bombay
real estate in the city is so pricey most poor people cannot afford anything more
so they've set up this shantytown on a hill near an enormous gray pipeline embedded in the ground
the city's main water supply gushes through it with great force
the slum dwellers have no legal access to the water but they've managed to drill small holes into the pipeline to tap the water illegally making it look like one long sprinkler
children crawl on top of the pipeline as women squat nearby with garbage all around washing their dishes in the spray
today a local official with ties to the national vjp is visiting the area
her name is sila bijado but she's known in these parts as thay or mother a crowd quickly gathers
thay says to the crowd tells these people what affection and respect you have for the vjp but that completely sets off a group of mostly women who clearly have many grievances
no one has done any work
we have no water no toilets no nothing
nothing gets done
no faucets no roads
they haven't even fixed our gutters so far
our children goes to a school that doesn't even have a toilet
thay says it's the congress party that's to blame for these problems not the vjp
the congress was in power for decades in this state the vjp only for the past year
the local vjp secretary harish tendrajipati was even less conciliatory and arrogantly confident
madam i'm telling in front of them they will vote for us and we won't have to pay them a penny for their vote
ninety nine percent of them will vote for us despite everything
a child may do wrong and his mother beats him but then she also loves him
that's what will happen on election day
mahatma ghandi once said that under his notion of democracy the weakest should have the same opportunities as the strongest
india's poor say democracy for them has all too often been about promises made then broken
for india's working class day to day life is not so unrelentingly harsh but they're just as disgusted with the politicians for different reasons
