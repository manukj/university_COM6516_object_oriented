# COM6516 Object Oriented Programming and Software Design Assignment
## Large Language Model 

The assignment entails constructing a custom hash table structure for developing a statistical language model. It involves implementing hash functions to map word sequences, managing collision clusters with linked lists, and exploring model properties via a graphical user interface. The focus is on simplicity, diverging from large neural network models.

#### How to run Code

There are 2 ways to run this program:

> Make sure that you are in the `/code` directory.

1. If the 'make' command is installed and you are using a bash shell, execute:

   ```
   make run
   ```

2. Compile the 'MyLanguageModel.java' file and then run the program:

   ```java
   // Compile the code
   javac MyLanguageModel.java

   // Run the program
   java MyLanguageModel
   ```
